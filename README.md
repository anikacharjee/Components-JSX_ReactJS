# Components-JSX_ReactJS
Using "Components" and "JSX" concepts in ReactJS

# Step 1: Create Components:
In your `src` directory, create two files: `App.js` and `HelloWorld.js`.

- Creating a simple React application with two components: **App** and **HelloWorld**. 
- The **App** component will render the **HelloWorld** component, demonstrating the use of `JSX` (JavaScript XML) in React.

# Step 2: Use Components in 'index.js':
Now, let's include the `App` component in the `index.js` file

- `import App from './App';`
- `<App/>`

# Step 3: Run the Application
- Ensure your development server is running (`npm start` in the terminal).
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
- You should see your React app displaying the `Welcome to My React App` heading along with the `HelloWorld` component content.
